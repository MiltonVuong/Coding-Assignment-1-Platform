  <p>Hello, I’m Milton. My interests span across various aspects of the tech industry. While I enjoy playing video games during my free time, my main focus outside of work is caring for my 15-month-old daughter, Elizabeth. Professionally, I’ve been a program manager at a tech company for several years, where I’ve gained valuable insights even though my exposure to coding has been limited. Now, I’m eager to develop a more formal understanding of programming and application development through this course.
